# Commercial Invoice Generation Tool

## Overview

This software was born out of a need to generate highly-detailed commercial invoices for products being imported into the United States of America
I work in the retail fixture and displays business, and thus the code as written is geared towards those product classifications. 

This is very wery much a work in progress. At present, the system does not store any historical values, no database of addresses, etc. All planned when I have time.
